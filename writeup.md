# **CarND Term 2 Project 2 Writeup** 
# **Unscented Kalman Filter** 

#### This repository contains a c++ implementation of an Model Predictive Control project. The repository is structured so that it works together with the [simulation environment provided by Udacity](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases). (The link between the environment and the code is via [uWebSocketIO](https://github.com/uNetworking/uWebSockets), and already provided by Udacity).

## Important scripts

This writeup will give an overview of the extended kalman filter implementation by going through 3 important scripts:

#### [1. main.cpp](#1.-main.cpp),
#### [2. tools.cpp](#2.-tools.cpp), and
#### [3. ukf.cpp](#3.-ukf.cpp).

### 1. main.cpp



### 2. tools.cpp

    VectorXd Tools::CalculateRMSE(const vector<VectorXd> &estimations,const vector<VectorXd> &ground_truth)

### 3. ukf.cpp



## Conclusion
